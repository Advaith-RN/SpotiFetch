## Components Required
- Arduino Uno R3
- Jumper Cables
- Alphanumeric LCD (I've used a 16x2)
- I2C Serial Interface Adapter Module (To connect to the LCD module)

## Instructions
- Download both the arduino file and the python file
- Wire up your Circuit according to the schematic. 
  - I recommend using a breadboard to connect the I2C module to the LCD
  - This ensures a secure connection
